# Program Description
This is project is called a triangle tracker. Its sole purpose is that it allows the user to enter any desired dimensions and it will be able to calculate whether the dimensions measure up to an; equilateral triangle, an iscoscles triangle or a scalene triangle. Furthermore, it will be able to tell if the entered dimensions measure up a real triangle or not. Moreover, if values entered are less or equal to zero, the program will be able to detect this and will show that a triangle's dimensions cannot be less or equal to zero.

# Setup Instructions
*clone the link from the github repo *run the link on google chrome.

# Languages Used in this Project
This particular project uses HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

# A breakdown of project in terms of Behaviour Driven Development (B.D.D.)
1- if the sum of two parameters is equal or exceeds the value of the third parameter, then the program will detect that the values do not form a realist triangle. --input - first value (6), second value (8), third value (15) --output - values do not match a triangle. 2- if the values entered are all equal to one another, then the program would recognise that the values form an equilateral triangle. --input - first value (5), second value (5), third value (5) --output - Triangle is Equilateral. 3- if two values in the input are equal, whereas the third value is different, then the program would recognise that the values make up an iscosceles triangle. --input - first value (5), second value (5), third value(7) --output - Triangle is Iscosceles. 4- if the values entered differ but still make up a realistic triangle, then the program will be able to recognise that the values make up a Scalene triangle. --input - first value (3), second value (4), third value (5) --output- Triangle is Scalene. 5- if the values entered for either side are less or equal to zero, the program will detect this and will tell you that a triangle parameters cannot be less or equal to zero. --input - first value (0), second value (6), third value (5) --output - Triangle parameters cannot be zero.
